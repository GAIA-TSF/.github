## Recommended Software Development Workflow

Coding style [PEP 8 (Style Guide for Python Code)]:

- Class names: `CapWords`
- Class properties/variables: `snake_case`
- Class methods/function names: `snake_case`
- Protected properties/methods: `_snake_case`
- Private properties/methods: `__snake_case`
- Package names should be short, all-lowercase, and preferably without underscores.

Branching Strategy

- main branch contains stable production-ready code
- feature branches for new features or fixes
- merge via Pull Requests (PR)

Collaboration and Code Review

- create PR for completed features or bugfix
- conduct peer code reviews
- use comments and suggestions to improve code quality
- resolve conflicts and ensure code consistency
- merge PR only when approved
- optionally use GitHub Projects to break into tasks, features, and bug fixes

Issue Tracking

- use GitHub Issues to manage tasks and bugs
- assign issues, set labels, milestones, and priorities
- link commits and PRs to issues

Continuous Integration (CI)

- configure GitHub Actions for automatic testing
- run unit tests and static analysis on every push and PR
- prevent merging if tests fail

Documentation

- update README with usage instructions
- document code with docstrings and comments

Release Management

- tag stable versions using semantic versioning
- create GitHub Releases with release notes

## Programming languange and style

- Python
- Object oriented paradigm
- tests driven by pytest package

Python package and modules:

Each subsystem module designed as a class:

## Deployment strategy

- use a unified deployment system (Docker?)
- use a unified base image (python-3.14?)
- use pre-built images for CI
